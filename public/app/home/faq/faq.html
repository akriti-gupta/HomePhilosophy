<button class="accordion">What is a First look?</button>
<div class="faq">
  <span>A <a href="#">First Look</a> is a customized concept board with real life items that suit your space, style and fit your budget. It provides you a 2D insight into how the space will look with all individual items together, all measured to fit accurately into your home. You can view these boards at anytime via your account on our website.</span>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Why do you only provide a shopping list?</button>
<div class="faq">
  <span>We understand the importance of seeing furniture in real, before buying; after all no two butts feel the same on a sofa! With our curated shopping list you simply go to the stores, make sure you love our picks, and buy only what you want.<br/><br/>No more confusing trips pouring over your floor plans and the furniture measurements!</span>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Where do you buy my furniture from?</button>
<div class="faq">
  <span>Home Philosophy does not work with preferred vendors- we source pieces from all over town. Right from Ikea to local shops and online retailers; our goal is to tirelessly scour the city for the best furniture to fit your style and budget.</span>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How long will my project take?</button>
<div class="faq">
  <span>You can have your new place ready in as quick as 2 weeks! It all depends on how quickly and detailed your feedback to us is.<br/><br/>

We endeavor to propose items that are in stock, or available within a few weeks. However, if you have a time crunch- let us know in advance so we can tailor our solutions accordingly. <br/><br/>

The availability of products will be indicated on your Shopping List, so we suggest snapping them up quickly to avoid disappointment in case stock changes.<br/><br/>

If you have chosen the option of a Buy For Me, we will inform you the approximate delivery time we receive from vendors. Please do note delivery is dependant on individual vendors and completely outside of our control. </span>
</div>

<button class="accordion">How does Buy For Me work?</button>
<div class="faq">
  <span>We want designing your home to be a hassle-free experience! So if you are happy with our concept boards, simply click this option during your final payment and leave the rest to us. For a small fee, we handle all the coordination of purchase, delivery and setup.

<br/><br/>Time to celebrate your move-in ready home!</span>
